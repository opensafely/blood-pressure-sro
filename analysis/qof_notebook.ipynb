    "> *The objective of the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) is to improve the quality of care patients are given by rewarding practices for the quality of care they provide to their patients, based on a number of indicators across a range of key areas of clinical care and public health.*\n",
    "> *QOF participation by GP practices is very high, with 96.7% of practices participating in the 2020/21 publication* ([NHSD, 2021b](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/quality-and-outcomes-framework-achievement-prevalence-and-exceptions-data/2020-21)).\n",

    "OpenSAFELY is a secure analytics platform for electronic patient records built by our group on behalf of NHS England to deliver urgent academic and operational research during the pandemic (e.g., [Curtis et al., 2021](https://bjgp.org/content/72/714/e63); [Williamson et al., 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2521-4)). \n",
    "Analyses can currently run across all patients' full pseudonymised primary care records, with patient-level linkage to various sources of secondary care data. \n",
    "The OpenSAFELY-TPP is a Trusted Research Environment (TRE) containing the routine clinical data of 23.4m people, approximately 40% of England’s population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently QOF reports are published at the end of the financial year, and consist of prevalence rates and indicator achievement rates for clinical areas by NHS geographic breakdowns from region to practice.\n",
    "We set out to replicate the indicator logic for a variety of QOF clinical indicators in OpenSAFELY-TPP and describe trends monthly over time, before and during the pandemic.\n",
    "We also describe how the indicators vary between key clinical, regional and demographic subgroups.\n",
    "\n",
    "High blood pressure is one of the leading risk factors for several diseases (e.g., cardiovascular disease, stroke) worldwide. \n",
    "Research suggests that delays in the management of high blood pressure are associated with worse clinical outcomes, for example acute cardiovascular events, or death ([Xu et al., 2015](https://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h158)).\n",
    "This report describes the results of implementing the blood pressure clinical indicator, the percentage of patients aged 45 or over who have a record of blood pressure in the preceding 5 years in the OpenSAFELY-TPP TRE. \n"
