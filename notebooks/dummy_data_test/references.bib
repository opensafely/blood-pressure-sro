  abstract = {PURPOSE We wanted to examine the long-term effects of the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF), a major pay-for-performance program in the United Kingdom, on ethnic disparities in diabetes outcomes. METHODS We undertook an interrupted time series analysis of electronic medical record data of diabetes patients registered with 29 family practices in South West London, United Kingdom. Main outcome measures were mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), total cholesterol, and blood pressure. RESULTS The introduction of QOF was associated with initial accelerated improvements in systolic blood pressure in white and black patients, but these improvements were sustained only in black patients (annual decrease: –1.68 mm Hg; 95\% CI, –2.41 to –0.95 mm Hg). Initial improvements in diastolic blood pressure in white patients (–1.01 mm Hg; 95\% CI, –1.79 to –0.24 mm Hg) and in cholesterol in white (–0.13 mmol/L; 95\% CI, –0.21 to –0.05 mmol/L) and black (–0.10 mmol/L; 95\% CI, –0.20 to –0.01 mmol/L) patients were not sustained in the post-QOF period. There was no beneficial impact of QOF on HbA1c in any ethnic group. Existing disparities in risk factor control remained largely intact (for example; mean HbA1c: white 7.5\%, black 7.8\%, south Asian 7.8\%; P {$<$}.05) at the end of the study period. CONCLUSION A universal pay-for-performance scheme did not appear to address important disparities in chronic disease management over time. Targeted quality improvement strategies may be required to improve health care in vulnerable populations.},

Aim To use Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) indicators to explore the characteristics of primary care in deprived communities. Design of study Two-year study. Setting Primary care in England. Method QOF data were obtained for each practice in England in 2004–2005 and 2005–2006 and linked with census derived social deprivation data (Index of Multiple Deprivation scores 2004), national urbanicity scores and a database of practice characteristics. Data were available for 8480 practices in 2004–2005 and 8264 practices in 2005–2006. Comparisons were made between practices in the least and most deprived quintiles. Results The difference in mean total QOF score between practices in least and most deprived quintiles was 64.5 points in 2004–2005 (mean score, all practices, 959.9) and 30.4 in 2005–2006 (mean, 1012.6). In 2005–2006, the QOF indicators displaying the largest differences between least and most deprived quintiles were: recall of patients not attending appointments for injectable neuroleptics (79 versus 58\%, respectively), practices opening ≥45 hours/week (90 versus 74\%), practices conducting ≥12 significant event audits in previous 3 years (93 versus 81 \%), proportion of epileptics who were seizure free ≥12 months (77 versus 65\%) and proportion of patients taking lithium with serum lithium within therapeutic range (90 versus 78\%). Geographical differences were less in group and training practices. Conclusions Overall differences between primary care quality indicators in deprived and prosperous communities were small. However, shortfalls in specific indicators, both clinical and non-clinical, suggest that focused interventions could be applied to improve the quality of primary care in deprived areas.},

Data were obtained from 8515 practices (99\% of practices in England) in year 1, 8264 (98\%) in year 2, 8192 (98\%) in year 3 and 8256 (99\%) in year 4. Outcome measures: QOF performance scores; social deprivation (IMD-2007) and ethnicity from the 2001 national census; general practice characteristics.ResultsWe identified a cohort of 212 (2.7\%) practices which remained in the lowest decile for total QOF scores in the four years following the introduction of the QOF. A total of 705,386 patients were registered at these practices in year 4. These practices were more likely to be singlehanded (odds ratio [OR], 13.8), non-training practices (OR, 3.9) and located in deprived areas (OR, 2.6; most vs least deprived quintiles). General practitioners (GPs) in these practices were more often aged ≥65 years or more (OR, 7.3; mean GP age ≥65 years vs {$<$}45 years), male (OR 2.0), UK qualified (OR 2.0) with small list sizes (OR 3.2; list size {$<$}1000 vs 1500-2000 patients). We identified individual QOF indicators which were poorly achieved. The reported prevalence of most chronic diseases was lower in the poorly performing cohort.ConclusionsA small minority of practices have remained poor performers in terms of measurable performance indicators over a four-year period. The strongest predictors of poor QOF performance were singlehanded and small practices, and practices staffed by elderly GPs.},

  abstract = {The tectonic plates of primary care appear to be shifting. In April 2016, Scotland abandoned the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF). Then, in October 2016, NHS Chief Executive Simon Stevens gave more than a hint that a similar fate awaits QOF in England. Meanwhile, Wales and Northern Ireland continue with the scheme — for now. Wider changes are afoot. The Five Year Forward View (5YFV) has trailed the formation of two radically changed models of primary care, termed Multi-Specialty Community Providers (MCPs) and Primary and Acute Care Systems (PACS).1 In the first, federations of GPs will form single community organisations, joining forces with mental health and social care, maximising the amount of out-of-hospital care. The alternative PACS model is a form of vertical integration with either primary or secondary care taking the lead in linking hospital services with community and mental health services. Both ‘new care models’ are likely to have substantial funding implications for GPs. Equally far reaching is the constraint provided by the 5YFV on the Department of Health, ensuring that in future only arrangements aligned to the delivery of 5YFV objectives will be supported. In Manchester, ‘Devo Manc’ became the first national example of a local authority taking control of its health and social care budget. The vision was to achieve ‘the greatest and fastest improvement to the health and wellbeing of the people of Manchester’ .2 In April 2016, 12 clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) and 15 foundation trusts or trusts joined together to provide health care. In practice, this model of devolution is likely to hand a greater say to local authorities in the commissioning of GP services. Again, the funding implications for GPs are unclear at this stage but are likely to be substantial. Meanwhile, in Scotland, the changes involve the complete dismantlement …},

Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting 147 general practices (annual list size over 1 million) across the UK. Patients People with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Main outcome measures Annual prevalence of diabetes and attainment of process and clinical outcomes over the three years before and the three years after the introduction of the quality and outcomes framework. Results Significant improvements in process and intermediate outcome measures were observed during the six year period, with consecutive annual improvements observed before the introduction of incentives. However, the current diagnostic case definition for the quality and outcomes framework does not capture up to two thirds of people with type 1 diabetes and a third of people with type 2 diabetes. After the introduction of the quality and outcomes framework, existing trends of improvement in glycaemic control, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure were attenuated, particularly in people with diabetes who did not meet the case definition of the quality and outcomes framework. The introduction of the quality and outcomes framework did not lead to improvement in the management of patients with type 1 diabetes, nor to a reduction in the number of patients with type 2 diabetes who had HbA1c levels greater than 10\%. Introduction of the quality and outcomes framework may have increased the number of patients with type 2 diabetes with HbA1c levels of ≤7.5\%; odds ratio 1.05 (95\% confidence interval 1.01 to 1.09; P=0.02). Conclusions The management of people with diabetes has improved since the late 1990s, but the impact of the quality and outcomes framework on care is not straightforward; upper thresholds may need to be removed or targets made more challenging if people are to benefit. Many patients in whom care may be suboptimal may not be captured in the quality and outcomes framework assessment.},

It is a source of contention, viewed by some as a ‘gaming’ mechanism. Aim To explore GP and practice staff views and experiences of exception reporting in the QOF. Design of study Qualitative semi-structured interviews. Setting Interviews with 24 GPs, 20 practice managers, 13 practice nurses, and nine other staff were conducted in 27 general practices in the UK. Method Semi-structured interviews, analysed using open explorative thematic coding. Results Exception reporting was seen as a clinically necessary part of the QOF. Exempting patients, particularly for discretionary reasons, was seen as an ‘exception to the rule’ that was justified either in terms of practising patient-centred care within a framework of population-based health measures or because of the poor face validity of the indicators. Rates in all practices were described as minimal and the threat of external scrutiny from primary care trusts kept rates low. However, GPs were happy to defend using discretionary exception codes for individual patients. Exception reporting was used, particularly at the end of the payment year, to meet unmet targets and to prevent the practice being penalised financially. Overt gaming was seen as something done by ‘other’ practices. Only two GPs admitted to occasional inappropriate exception reporting. Conclusion Exception reporting is seen by most GPs and practice staff as an important and defensible safeguard against inappropriate treatment or over-treatment of patients. However, a minority of practitioners also saw it as a gaming mechanism.},

  abstract = {The 2004 UK Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) remunerates general practitioners for achieving a target blood pressure (BP) of ⩽150/90\,mm\,Hg for patients with ischaemic heart disease, stroke and hypertension. Using the DIN-LINK GP database, we investigated whether introducing the target altered BP recording. We extracted 3\,164\,189 BP measurements from 236\,467 patients, with the above diagnoses from 2000 to 2005. Treatment was assessed by Read codes indicating prescriptions for antihypertensive drugs. Over this period, recorded systolic BP (SBP) fell: 36\% had an SBP {$>$}150\,mm\,Hg in 2000–2001, and only 19\% in 2004–2005. However, there was a trend towards recording systolic values just below, rather than just above the 150 cut-off. In 2000–2001, 2.3\% of patients had 148–149 recorded and 1.8\% had 151–152. In 2004–2005, the figures were 4.2 and 1.3\%, respectively. By smoothing the distribution we estimate that the true percentage of patients with SBP{$>$}150\,mm\,Hg in 2004–2005 was 23\%, rather than the 19\% recorded. Moreover, patients with a recorded SBP=148–149 were more likely to have a recorded diastolic BP⩽90 (93\%) than patients with SBP=151–152 (78\%). However, patients just below the 150\,mm\,Hg cut-off received more antihypertensive treatment than those just above it (odds ratio=1.20, 95\% confidence interval 1.01–1.41). We conclude that blood pressure levels in UK primary care have continued to fall through the introduction of QOF, offering significant public health benefits in the future. This fall has been exaggerated due to values being clustered just below the QOF target, but there is no evidence of adverse effects of this on clinical management.},

  abstract = {Objectives To evaluate a county-wide deincentivisation of the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) payment scheme for UK General Practice (GP). Setting In 2014, National Health Service England signalled a move towards devolution of QOF to Clinical Commissioning Groups. Fifty-five GPs in Somerset established the Somerset Practice Quality Scheme (SPQS)—a deincentivisation of QOF—with the goal of redirecting resources towards Person Centred Coordinated Care (P3C), especially for those with long-term conditions (LTCs). We evaluated the impact on processes and outcomes of care from April 2016 to March 2017. Participants and design The evaluation used data from 55 SPQS practices and 17 regional control practices for three survey instruments. We collected patient experiences (‘P3C-EQ’; 2363 returns from patients with 1+LTC; 36\% response rate), staff experiences (‘P3C-practitioner’; 127 professionals) and organisational data (‘P3C-OCT’; 36 of 55 practices at two time points, 65\% response rate; 17 control practices). Hospital Episode Statistics emergency admission data were analysed for 2014–2017 for ambulatory-sensitive conditions across Somerset using interrupted time series. Results Patient and practitioner experiences were similar in SPQS versus control practices. However, discretion from QOF incentives resulted in time savings in the majority of practices, and SPQS practice data showed a significant increase in P3C oriented organisational processes, with a moderate effect size (Wilcoxon signed rank test; p=0.01; r=0.42). Analysis of transformation plans and organisational data suggested stronger federation-level agreements and informal networks, increased multidisciplinary working, reallocation of resources for other healthcare professionals and changes to the structure and timings of GP appointments. No disbenefits were detected in admission data. Conclusion The SPQS scheme leveraged time savings and reduced administrative burden via discretionary removal of QOF incentives, enabling practices to engage actively in a number of schemes aimed at improving care for people with LTCs. We found no differences in the experiences of patients or healthcare professionals between SPQS and control practices.},

  abstract = {Background The quality and outcomes framework is a financial incentive scheme that remunerates general practices in the UK for their performance against a set of quality indicators. Incentive schemes can increase inequalities in the delivery of care if practices in affluent areas are more able to respond to the incentives than are those in deprived areas. We examined the relation between socioeconomic inequalities and delivered quality of clinical care in the first 3 years of this scheme. Methods We analysed data extracted automatically from clinical computing systems for 7637 general practices in England, data from the UK census, and data for characteristics of practices and patients from the 2006 general medical statistics database. Practices were grouped into equal-sized quintiles on the basis of area deprivation in their locality. We calculated overall levels of achievement, defined as the proportion of patients who were deemed eligible by the practices for whom the targets were achieved, for 48 clinical activity indicators during the first 3 years of the incentive scheme (from 2004–05 to 2006–07). Findings Median overall reported achievement was 85·1\% (IQR 79·0–89·1) in year 1, 89·3\% (86·0–91·5) in year 2, and 90·8\% (88·5–92·6) in year 3. In year 1, area deprivation was associated with lower levels of achievement, with median achievement ranging from 86·8\% (82·2–89·6) for quintile 1 (least deprived) to 82·8\% (75·2–87·8) for quintile 5 (most deprived). Between years 1 and 3, median achievement increased by 4·4\% for quintile 1 and by 7·6\% for quintile 5, and the gap in median achievement narrowed from 4·0\% to 0·8\% during this period. Increase in achievement during this time was inversely associated with practice performance in previous years (p{$<$}0·0001), but was not associated with area deprivation (p=0·062). Interpretation Our results suggest that financial incentive schemes have the potential to make a substantial contribution to the reduction of inequalities in the delivery of clinical care related to area deprivation. Funding None.},

  abstract = {Primary care in the United Kingdom faced a crisis in 2000. General practitioners (GPs) complained of low morale, long hours, and low pay. The quality of care delivered to patients, meanwhile, was highly variable. The U.K. government responded with a program of quality improvement initiatives, a substantial increase in funding, and an ambitious pay-for-performance scheme that introduced publicly reported quality-of-care targets. Following these reforms, GPs’ income and morale increased, the number of working hours declined, and the quality of care improved. The reforms, however, presented a serious challenge to medical professionalism, and the long-term effects on patient outcomes remain uncertain.}

Setting 148 general practices in England (653 500 patients). Main outcome measures Achievement rates projected from trends in the pre-incentive period (2000-1 to 2002-3) and actual rates in the first three years of the scheme (2004-5 to 2006-7). Results Achievement rates improved for most indicators in the pre-incentive period. There were significant increases in the rate of improvement in the first year of the incentive scheme (2004-5) for 22 of the 23 incentivised indicators. Achievement for these indicators reached a plateau after 2004-5, but quality of care in 2006-7 remained higher than that predicted by pre-incentive trends for 14 incentivised indicators. There was no overall effect on the rate of improvement for non-incentivised indicators in the first year of the scheme, but by 2006-7 achievement rates were significantly below those predicted by pre-incentive trends. Conclusions There were substantial improvements in quality for all indicators between 2001 and 2007. Improvements associated with financial incentives seem to have been achieved at the expense of small detrimental effects on aspects of care that were not incentivised.},

Design Retrospective analysis. Setting Data for 2008-9 extracted from the clinical computing systems of general practices in England. Participants 8229 English family practices. Main outcome measures Rates of exception reporting for 37 clinical quality indicators, associations of patient and general practice factors with exception rates, and financial gain for practices relating to their use of exception reporting. Results The median rate of exception reporting was 2.7\% (interquartile range 1.9-3.9\%) overall and 0.44\% (0.14-1.1\%) for informed dissent, but variation in rates was wide between practices and across indicators. Common reasons for exception reporting were logistical (40.6\% of exceptions), clinical contraindication (18.7\%), and patient informed dissent (30.1\%). Higher rates of informed dissent were associated with: higher numbers of registered patients, higher levels of local area deprivation, and failure of the practice to secure maximum remuneration in the previous year. Exception reporting increased the cost of the scheme by £30 844 500 (€36 877 700; \$49 053 200) (£0.58 per patient), with two indicators accounting for a quarter of this additional cost. Conclusions The provision to exception report enables practices to exempt dissenting patients without being financially penalised. Relatively few patients were excluded for informed dissent, however, suggesting that the incentivised activities were broadly acceptable to patients.},

  abstract = {Objectives To characterise serum creatinine and urinary protein testing in UK general practices from 2005 to 2013 and to examine how the frequency of testing varies across demographic factors, with the presence of chronic conditions and with the prescribing of drugs for which kidney function monitoring is recommended. Design Retrospective open cohort study. Setting Routinely collected data from 630 UK general practices contributing to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Participants 4 573 275 patients aged over 18 years registered at up-to-standard practices between 1 April 2005 and 31 March 2013. At study entry, no patients were kidney transplant donors or recipients, pregnant or on dialysis. Primary outcome measures The rate of serum creatinine and urinary protein testing per year and the percentage of patients with isolated and repeated testing per year. Results The rate of serum creatinine testing increased linearly across all age groups. The rate of proteinuria testing increased sharply in the 2009–2010 financial year but only for patients aged 60 years or over. For patients with established chronic kidney disease (CKD), creatinine testing increased rapidly in 2006–2007 and 2007–2008, and proteinuria testing in 2009–2010, reflecting the introduction of Quality and Outcomes Framework indicators. In adjusted analyses, CKD Read codes were associated with up to a twofold increase in the rate of serum creatinine testing, while other chronic conditions and potentially nephrotoxic drugs were associated with up to a sixfold increase. Regional variation in serum creatinine testing reflected country boundaries. Conclusions Over a nine-year period, there have been increases in the numbers of patients having kidney function tests annually and in the frequency of testing. Changes in the recommended management of CKD in primary care were the primary determinant, and increases persist even after controlling for demographic and patient-level factors. Future studies should address whether increased testing has led to better outcomes.},

It has been suggested that the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF), a primary care pay-for-performance scheme that rewards practices for delivering effective interventions in long-term conditions, does not encourage high-quality care for this group of patients. Aim To examine the evidence that the QOF has improved quality of care for patients with long-term conditions. Design and setting This was a systematic review of research on the effectiveness of the QOF in the UK. Method The authors searched electronic databases for peer-reviewed empirical quantitative research studying the effect of the QOF on a broad range of processes and outcomes of care, including coordination and integration of care, holistic and personalised care, self-care, patient experience, physiological and biochemical outcomes, health service utilisation, and mortality. Because the studies were heterogeneous, a narrative synthesis was carried out. Results The authors identified three systematic reviews and five primary research studies that met the inclusion criteria. The QOF was associated with a modest slowing of both the increase in emergency admissions and the increase in consultations in severe mental illness (SMI), and modest improvements in diabetes care. The nature of the evidence means that the authors cannot be sure that any of these associations is causal. No clear effect on mortality was found. The authors found no evidence that the QOF influences integration or coordination of care, holistic care, self-care, or patient experience. Conclusion The NHS should consider more broadly what constitutes high-quality primary care for people with long-term conditions, and consider other ways of motivating primary care to deliver it.},

While the political willingness to provide universal health coverage is a step into the right direction, the benefits of it will depend on the quality of healthcare services provided. In this analysis paper, we ask whether there are any lessons that could be learnt from the English National Health Service, a healthcare system that has been providing comprehensive and high-quality universal health coverage for over 70 years. The key areas identified relate to the development of a coherent strategy to improve quality, to boost public health as a measure to reduce disease burden, to adopt evidence-based priority setting methods that ensure efficient spending of financial resources, to introduce an independent way of inspecting and regulating providers, and to allow for task-shifting, specifically in regions where staff retention is low.},

Aim To assess the impact of the QOF on GP consultation rates for patients with diabetes mellitus. Design and setting This study used interrupted time series of 13 248 745 general practice consultations for 37 065 patients with diabetes mellitus in England. Method Clinical Practice Research Datalink general practice data were used from 2000/2001 to 2014/2015, with introduction of the QOF (1 April 2004) as the intervention, and mean annual GP consultation rates as the primary outcome. Results Mean annual GP clinical consultation rates were 8.10 per patient in 2000/2001, 6.91 in 2004/2005, and 7.09 in 2014/2015. Introduction of the QOF was associated with an annual change in the trend of GP clinical consultation rates of 0.46 (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.23 to 0.69, P = 0.001) consultations per patient, giving a post-QOF trend increasing by 0.018 consultations per year. Introduction of the QOF was associated with an immediate stepped increase of ‘other’ out-of-hours and non-clinical encounters, and trend change of 0.57 (95\% CI = 0.34 to 0.81, P{$<$}0.001) per year, resulting in a post-QOF trend increasing by 0.27 other encounters per year. Conclusion Introduction of the QOF was associated with a modest increase in clinical GP consultation rates and substantial increase in other encounters for patients with diabetes independent of changes in diabetes prevalence. National prevalence of diabetes increased by 90.7\% from 2004/2005 to 2014/2015, which, combined with this study’s findings, means GPs would have provided nearly double the number of consultations for patients with diabetes over this timescale.},

This article reviews the growing evidence for the impact of the framework on the quality of primary medical care. METHODS Five hundred seventy-five articles were identified by searching the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases, and from the reference lists of published reviews and articles. One hundred twenty-four relevant articles were assessed using a modified Downs and Black rating scale for 110 observational studies and a Critical Appraisal Skills Programme rating scale for 14 qualitative studies. Ninety-four studies were included in the review. RESULTS Quality of care for incentivized conditions during the first year of the framework improved at a faster rate than the preintervention trend and subsequently returned to prior rates of improvement. There were modest cost-effective reductions in mortality and hospital admissions in some domains. Differences in performance narrowed in deprived areas compared with nondeprived areas. Achievement for conditions outside the framework was lower initially and has worsened in relative terms since inception. Some doctors reported improved data recording and teamwork, and nurses enhanced specialist skills. Both groups believed that the person-centeredness of consultations and continuity were negatively affected. Patients’ satisfaction with continuity declined, with little change in other domains of patient experience. CONCLUSIONS Observed improvements in quality of care for chronic diseases in the framework were modest, and the impact on costs, professional behavior, and patient experience remains uncertain. Further research is needed into how to improve quality across different domains, while minimizing costs and any unintended adverse effects of payment for performance schemes. Health care organizations should remain cautious about the benefits of similar schemes.},

  abstract = {Background In many UK general practices, nurses have been used to deliver results against the indicators of the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF), a ‘pay for performance’ scheme. Aim To determine the association between the level of nurse staffing in general practice and the quality of clinical care as measured by the QOF. Design of the study Cross-sectional analysis of routine data. Setting English general practice in 2005/2006. Method QOF data from 7456 general practices were linked with a database of practice characteristics, nurse staffing data, and census-derived data on population characteristics and measures of population density. Multi-level modelling explored the relationship between QOF performance and the number of patients per fulltime equivalent nurse. The outcome measures were achievement of quality of care for eight clinical domains as rated by the QOF, and reported achievement of 10 clinical outcome indicators derived from it. Results A high level of nurse staffing (fewer patients per fulltime equivalent practice-employed nurse) was significantly associated with better performance in 4/8 clinical domains of the QOF (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension, P = 0.004 to P{$<$}0.001) and in 4/10 clinical outcome indicators (diabetes: glycosylated haemoglobin [HbA1C] ≤7.4\%, HbA1C ≤10\% and total cholesterol ≤193 mg/dl; and stroke: total cholesterol ≤5 mmol/L, P = 0.0057 to P{$<$}0.001). Conclusion Practices that employ more nurses perform better in a number of clinical domains measured by the QOF. This improved performance includes better intermediate clinical outcomes, suggesting real patient benefit may be associated with using nurses to deliver care to meet QOF targets.},

This information gap is attributable in part to the heterogeneity of healthcare financing, covered medical conditions, care settings, and provider remuneration arrangements within and across countries. We systematically reviewed the literature concentrating on whether P4P for physicians in primary and community care leads to better diabetes outcomes in single-payer national health insurance systems. Methods Studies were identified by searching ten databases (01/2000–04/2018) and scanning the reference lists of review articles and other global health literature. We included primary studies evaluating the effects of introducing P4P for diabetes care among primary care physicians in countries of universal health coverage. Outcomes of interest included patient morbidity, avoidable hospitalization, premature death, and healthcare costs. Results We identified 2218 reports; after exclusions, 10 articles covering 8 P4P interventions in 7 countries were eligible for analysis. Five studies, capturing records from 717,166 patients with diabetes, were graded as high-quality evaluations of P4P on health outcomes. Based on three quality studies, P4P can result in reduced risk of mortality over the longer term—when linked to performance metrics. However, studies from other jurisdictions, where P4P was not linked to specific patient-oriented objectives, yielded little or mixed evidence of positive health impacts. Conclusion Evidence of the effectiveness of P4P depends on whether physicians’ incentive payments are explicitly tied to performance metrics. However, the most appropriate indicators for performance monitoring remain in question. More research with rigorous evaluation in different settings is needed.},

  abstract = {Background: The Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) incentivises general practices in England to provide proactive care for people with serious mental illness (SMI) including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and other psychoses. Better proactive primary care may reduce the risk of psychiatric admissions to hospital, but this has never been tested empirically. Methods: The QOF data set included 8234 general practices in England from 2006/2007 to 2010/2011. Rates of hospital admissions with primary diagnoses of SMI or bipolar disorder were estimated from national routine hospital data and aggregated to practice level. Poisson regression was used to analyse associations. Results: Practices with higher achievement on the annual review for SMI patients (MH9), or that performed better on either of the two lithium indicators for bipolar patients (MH4 or MH5), had more psychiatric admissions. An additional 1\% in achievement rates for MH9 was associated with an average increase in the annual practice admission rate of 0.19\% (95\% CI 0.10\% to 0.28\%) or 0.007 patients (95\% CI 0.003 to 0.01). Conclusions: The positive association was contrary to expectation, but there are several possible explanations: better quality primary care may identify unmet need for secondary care; higher QOF achievement may not prevent the need for secondary care; individuals may receive their QOF checks postdischarge rather than prior to admission; individuals with more severe SMI may be more likely to be registered with practices with better QOF performance; and QOF may be a poor measure of the quality of care for people with SMI.},

  abstract = {Background Scotland abolished the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) in April 2016, before implementing a new Scottish GP contract in April 2018. Since 2016, groups of practices (GP clusters) have been incentivised to meet regularly to plan and organise quality improvement (QI) as part of this new direction in primary care policy. Aim To understand the organisation and perceived impact of GP clusters, including how they use quantitative data for improvement. Design and setting Thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders (n = 17) and observations of GP cluster meetings (n = 6) in two clusters. Method This analytical strategy was combined with a purposive (variation) sampling approach to the sources of data, to try to identify commonalities across diverse stakeholder experiences of working in or on the idea of GP clusters. Variation was sought particularly in terms of stakeholders’ level of involvement in improvement initiatives, and in their disciplinary affiliations. Results There was uncertainty as to whether GP clusters should focus on activities generated internally or externally by the wider healthcare system (for example, from Scottish Health Boards), although the two observed clusters generally generated their own ideas and issues. Clusters operated with variable administrative/managerial and data support, and variable baseline leadership experience and QI skills. Qualitative approaches formed the focus of collaborative learning in cluster meetings, through sharing and discussion of member practices’ own understandings and experiences. Less evidence was observed of data analytics being championed in these meetings, partly because of barriers to accessing the analytics data and existing data quality. Conclusion Cluster development would benefit from more consistent training and support for cluster leads in small-group facilitation, leadership, and QI expertise, and data analytics access and capacity. While GP clusters are up and running, their impact is likely to be limited without further investment in developing capacity in these areas.},

  abstract = {Background Structured diabetes care can improve outcomes and reduce risk of complications, but improving care in a deprived, ethnically diverse area can prove challenging. This report evaluates a system change to enhance diabetes care delivery in a primary care setting. Methods All 35 practices in one inner London Primary Care Trust were geographically grouped into eight networks of four to five practices, each supported by a network manager, clerical staff and an educational budget. A multidisciplinary team developed a ‘care package’ for type 2 diabetes management, with financial incentives based on network achievement of targets. Monthly electronic performance dashboards enabled networks to track and improve performance. Network multidisciplinary team meetings including the diabetic specialist team supported case management and education. Key measures for improvement included the number of diabetes care plans completed, proportion of patients attending for digital retinal screen and proportions of patients achieving a number of biomedical indices (blood pressure, cholesterol, glycated haemoglobin). Results Between 2009 and 2012, completed care plans rose from 10\% to 88\%. The proportion of patients attending for digital retinal screen rose from 72\% to 82.8\%. The proportion of patients achieving a combination of blood pressure ≤140/80 mm Hg and cholesterol ≤4 mmol/L rose from 35.3\% to 46.1\%. Mean glycated haemoglobin dropped from 7.80\% to 7.66\% (62–60 mmol/mol). Conclusions Investment of financial, organisational and education resources into primary care practice networks can achieve clinically important improvements in diabetes care in deprived, ethnically diverse communities. This success is predicated on collaborative working between practices, purposively designed high-quality information on network performance and engagement between primary and secondary care clinicians.},

This article investigates the association between healthcare spending, deprivation and outcomes.

Methods Financial data were analysed alongside key outcome data, including quality and outcomes framework (QOF) indicators for a large urban primary care trust (PCT) in the UK. The PCT had a large population and number of practices, including single-handed practices and an average list size in excess of 5000. The PCT will remain anonymous. Results There was no relationship between primary care investment and the practices' deprivation score. There was a strong statistically significant negative correlation between QOF payments and deprivation, (correlation = −0.46, p {$<$} 0.001). There were only weak links between primary care investment and health outcomes. There was no relationship between high emergency spending and health outcome.

Introduction of quality outcomes framework (QOF) performance indicators may have altered GP recording of depression. Methods Time trend analyses of GP recording of depression before and after the recession (from April 2008), and the QOF (from April 2006) were conducted on anonymised consultation data from 142 English practices contributing to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, April 2003–March 2013. Results 293,596 patients had computer codes for depressive diagnoses or symptoms in the 10 years. Prevalence of depression codes fell from 44.6 (95\% CI 44.2, 45.0) per 1000 person years at risk (PYAR) in 2003/2004 to 38.0 (37.7, 38.3) in 2008/2009, rising to 39.5 (39.2, 39.9) in 2012/2013. Incidence of first-ever depression codes fell from 11.9 (95\% CI 11.7, 12.1) per 1000 PYAR in 2003/2004 to 9.5 (9.3, 9.7) in 2008/2009, rising to 10.0 (9.8, 10.2) in 2012/1203. Prevalence increased in men but not women following the recession, associated with increased unemployment. Following introduction of the QOF, GPs used more non-QOF-qualifying symptom or other codes than QOF-qualifying diagnostic codes for new episodes. Limitations Clinical data recording is probably incomplete. Participating practices were relatively large and not representative across English regions. Conclusions Rates of recorded depression in English general practices were falling prior to the economic recession but increased again subsequently, among men, associated with increased unemployment. GPs responded to the QOF by switching from diagnostic to symptom codes, removing most depressed patients from the denominator for measuring GP performance in assessing depression.},

Treatment rates for first-ever episodes fell from 72.5\% (70.8–74.1\%) in Quarter 2 (Q2) 2003 to 61.0\% (59.3–62.7\%) in Q1 2012, but treatment rates for recurrent episodes increased from 74.3\% (72.8–75.8\%) to 77.8\% (76.5–79.1\%), so overall rates remained around 70\%. Mean prescriptions per patient per year doubled from 2.06 (2.05–2.07) to 3.98 (3.97–3.99). Limitations Participating practices were larger than average and not representative across regions. Inferences of cause and effect from time trend analyses are subject to the possibility of unidentified confounders. No data were available on depression severity or appropriateness of prescribing. Conclusions Rates of GP antidepressant treatment for patients with incident depression fell following introduction of NICE depression guidelines and the QOF, but treatment rates for recurrent depression increased. Prescription numbers increased due to longer treatment courses. To impact on antidepressant prescribing rates, guidelines and performance indicators must address recurrent and long-term prescribing, rather than initial treatment decisions.},

Methods medline and embase were searched for articles published from 1999 to June 2006. We also searched for reference lists of studies that fitted our inclusion criteria. All members of the Primary Care Diabetes Europe were contacted and asked to send lists of any relevant published articles. Abstracts were reviewed and data were collected independently by two authors. Results Abstracts of 742 papers were identified, of which six papers fulfilled the final selection criteria. The total number of people included in the six published studies was 83 098 (a range of 504 to 54 180 people) compared with the UK QOF data of 1.8 million people with diabetes. The quality indicators for assessment of care varied between different published studies, making comparisons more difficult. Overall, there was a trend towards improvement in both process and outcome of care in the published studies. The quality of care achieved as a result of QOF was greater than that found in published studies. Conclusions There have been improvements in both process and outcome measures recorded in publications of quality of diabetes care in the UK between 2000 and 2004. Modest financial incentives in primary care are a successful method of improving care for people with diabetes.},

  abstract = {Background The Quality and Outcomes Framework, a financial incentive scheme for general practitioners in the UK, seems to have improved the quality of primary care and reduced inequalities in primary care delivery. It remains unclear, however, whether higher-quality primary care improves health outcomes or reduces health inequalities. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study examining the association between quality of cardiovascular care and coronary heart disease (CHD) outcomes in 1531 general practices in London. We calculated CHD quality achievement scores (ranging from 0 to 100) for each practice using the 2006–2007 data from the Quality and Outcomes Framework. We used weighted linear regression models to assess the practice-level association between the CHD quality score and CHD admissions and deaths. Findings Overall, practices with higher CHD quality achievement scores had better CHD outcomes. Each one point increase in the CHD quality achievement score was associated with 4.28 (95\% CI 1.19 to 7.38; p=0.007) fewer admissions per 100 000 for practices serving highly deprived populations and 2.11 (95\% CI 0.68 to 3.55; p=0.004) fewer admissions per 100 000 for practices serving populations of average deprivation. There was no association between the CHD quality achievement score and the CHD admissions for practices serving affluent populations (p=0.906). We observed a similar deprivation-dependent gradient between quality achievement and CHD deaths. Interpretation High-quality primary care is associated with improved health outcomes. This association is strongest in deprived areas, suggesting that high-quality primary care may play an important role in reducing health inequalities.},

Design Retrospective longitudinal study. Setting Data for 644 general practices, from 2004/05 to 2011/12, extracted from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Participants All patients registered with any of the practices over the study period—13 772 992 in total. Intervention Removal of financial incentives for aspects of care for patients with asthma, coronary heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and psychosis. Main outcome measures Performance on eight clinical quality indicators withdrawn from a national incentive scheme: influenza immunisation (asthma) and lithium treatment monitoring (psychosis), removed in April 2006; blood pressure monitoring (coronary heart disease, diabetes, stroke), cholesterol concentration monitoring (coronary heart disease, diabetes), and blood glucose monitoring (diabetes), removed in April 2011. Multilevel mixed effects multiple linear regression models were used to quantify the effect of incentive withdrawal. Results Mean levels of performance were generally stable after the removal of the incentives, in both the short and long term. For the two indicators removed in April 2006, levels in 2011/12 were very close to 2005/06 levels, although a small but statistically significant drop was estimated for influenza immunisation. For five of the six indicators withdrawn from April 2011, no significant effect on performance was seen following removal and differences between predicted and observed scores were small. Performance on related outcome indicators retained in the scheme (such as blood pressure control) was generally unaffected. Conclusions Following the removal of incentives, levels of performance across a range of clinical activities generally remained stable. This indicates that health benefits from incentive schemes can potentially be increased by periodically replacing existing indicators with new indicators relating to alternative aspects of care. However, all aspects of care investigated remained indirectly or partly incentivised in other indicators, and further work is needed to assess the generalisability of the findings when incentives are fully withdrawn.},

However, in 2009, potential new indicators were piloted in a nationally representative sample of practices. This paper describes an in-depth exploration of family physician, nurse and other primary-care practice staff views of the value of piloting with a particular focus on unintended consequences of 13 potential new QOF indicators.MethodFifty-seven family-practice professionals were interviewed in 24 representative practices across England.ResultsAlmost all interviewees emphasised the value of piloting in terms of an opportunity to identify unintended consequences of potential QOF indicators in ‘real world’ settings with staff who deliver day-to-day care to patients. Four particular types of unintended consequences were identified: measure fixation, tunnel vision, misinterpretation and potential gaming. ‘Measure fixation,’ an inappropriate attention on isolated aspects of care, appeared to be the key unintended consequence. In particular, if the palliative care indicator had been introduced without piloting, this might have incentivised poorer care in a minority of practices with potential harm to vulnerable patients.ConclusionsIt is important to identify concerns and experiences about unintended consequences of indicators at an early stage when there is time to remove or adapt problem indicators. Since the UK government currently spends over £1 billion each year on QOF, the £150\hphantom{,}000 spent on each piloting cohort (0.0005\% of the total QOF budget) appears to be good value for money.},

The 2004 Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) contract, based on 146 outcome indicators, links income to performance on a scale never before seen in the UK. To outsiders it seems that UK general practice has moved from having an internal framework of professionalism that supports it, to an external framework that holds it up and embraces a market model of healthcare with performance linked bonuses and its own acronym: P4P (pay for performance). New Zealand looks set to follow the same path. On reading through the QOF indicator list, our concerns have deepened. The mix of indicators looks like a hotchpotch of intermediate clinical and practice based ‘outcomes’. The list has the hallmark of those who think in terms of contracts, numbers, and linear production- line performance targets. This all purports to be in the name of evidence-based care, but we have looked in vain for evidence underpinning this radical, risky, and very expensive policy. The issue at the core of the relationship between QOFs and general practice is not the indicators chosen nor whether GPs should be paid what they are worth. The fundamental issue is a philosophical one that centres on the nature of professionalism, professional values, and the concept of good care. State-driven clinical priorities are risking general practice's disciplinary identity. By allowing ourselves to be coerced into persuading …},

Although aspects of MMI (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and related psychoses) are incentivised, barriers to care may occur. Aim To compare payment, population achievement, and exception rates for blood pressure and BMI recording in MMI relative to diabetes and CKD across the UK. Design and setting Analysis of 2012/2013 QOF data from 9731 UK general practices 2 years after the introduction of the mental health, BMI, and blood pressure QOF indicators. Method Payment, exception, and population achievement rates for the MMI and CKD blood pressure indicators and the MMI and diabetes BMI indicators were calculated and compared. Results UK payment and population achievement rates for BMI recording for MMI were significantly lower than for diabetes (payment: 92.7\% versus 95.5\% and population achievement: 84.0\% versus 92.5\%, P{$<$}0.001) and exception rates were higher (8.1\% versus 2.0\%, P{$<$}0.001). For blood pressure recording, UK payment and population achievement rates were significantly lower for MMI than for CKD (94.1\% versus 97.8\% and 87.0\% versus 97.1\%, P{$<$}0.001), while exception rate was higher (6.5\% versus 0.0\%, P{$<$}0.001). This was observed for all countries. Compared with England, Northern Ireland had higher population achievement rates for both mental health indicators, whereas Scotland and Wales had lower rates. There were no cross-jurisdiction differences for CKD and diabetes. Conclusion Differences in payment, exception, and population achievement rates for blood pressure and BMI recording for MMI relative to CKD and diabetes were observed across the UK. These findings suggest potential inequalities in the monitoring of physical health in MMI within the UK primary care system.},

Setting and participants: 1024 general practices in Scotland. Main outcome measures: Regression coefficients summarising the relationships between deprivation and payment and delivered quality. Results: Little systematic association is found between payment quality and deprivation but, for 17 of the 33 indicators examined, delivered quality falls with increasing deprivation. Absolute differences in delivered quality are small for most simpler process measures, such as recording of smoking status or blood pressure. Greater inequalities are seen for more complex process measures such as diagnostic procedures, some intermediate outcome measures such as glycaemic control in diabetes and measures of treatment such as influenza immunisation. Conclusions: The exclusions system succeeds in not penalising practices financially for the characteristics of the population they serve, but does not reward the additional work required in deprived areas and contributes to a continuation of the inverse care law. The contract data collected prevent examination of most complex process or treatment measures and this analysis is likely to underestimate the extent of continuing inequalities in care. Broader lessons cannot be drawn on the effect on inequalities of this new set of incentives until changes are made to the way contract data are collected and analysed.},

However, with the exception of retinal screening, peripheral pulses and neuropathy testing, differences in achievement between small and large practices were modest ({$<$}5\%). Small practices performed nearly as well as the largest practices in achievement of intermediate outcome targets for HbA1c, blood pressure and cholesterol (smallest versus largest practices: 57.4\% versus 58.7\%; 70.7\% versus 70.7\%; and 69.5\% versus 72.7\%, respectively).

Aim To explore primary care practitioner perspectives on the clinical utility of the NICE guideline and the impact of the QOF on diagnosis and management of depression in routine practice. Design and setting Qualitative study using focus groups from four multidisciplinary practice teams with diverse populations in south Yorkshire. Method Four focus groups were conducted, using a topic guide and audiotaping. There were 38 participants: GPs, nurses, doctors in training, mental health workers, and a manager. Data analysis was iterative and thematic. Results The NICE guideline, with its embedded principles of holism and evidence-based practice, was viewed positively but its impact was compromised by resource and practitioner barriers to implementation. The perceived imposition of the screening questions and severity assessments (PHQ-9) with no responsive training had required practitioners to work hard to minimise negative impacts on their work, for example: constantly adapting consultations to tick boxes; avoiding triggering open displays of distress without the time to offer appropriate care; positively managing how their patients were labelled. Further confusion was experienced around the evolving content of psychological interventions for depression. Conclusion Organisational barriers to the implementation of the NICE guideline and the limited scope of the QOF highlight the need for policy makers to work more effectively with the complex realities of general practice in order to systematically improve the quality and delivery of ‘managed’ care for depression.},

This ethnographic study explored how QOF's monetary logic influences the approach to healthcare in UK general practice. From August 2013 to April 2014, we researched two UK general practice surgeries and one general practice training programme. These environments provided the opportunity for studying various spaces such as QOF meetings, consultation rooms, QOF recoding sessions, and the collection of computer-screen images depicting how patients' biomarkers are evaluated and costed through software systems. QOF as a biomedical technology has led to the commodification of patients and their bodies. This complex phenomenon breaks down into three main themes: commodification of patients, QOF as currency, and valuing commodities. Despite the ostensible aim of QOF being to improve healthcare in general practice, it is accompanied by a body commodification process. The interface between patients and care providers has been commodified, with QOF's pricing mechanism and fragmentation of care provision performing an important role in animating the UK economy.},

In a historical perspective, the Department of Health (United Kingdom) developed and proposed a range of indicators in 1998, and lately several health, social and political organizations have defined and implemented different sets of PHC quality indicators. Some systematic reviews in PHC quality indicators are reported but only in specific contexts and conditions. The aim of this study is to characterize and provide a list of indicators discussed in the literature to support managers and clinicians in decision-making processes, through an umbrella review on PHC quality indicators. The methodology was performed according to PRISMA Statement. Indicators from 33 eligible systematic reviews were categorized according to the dimensions of care, function, type of care, domains and condition contexts. Of a total of 727 indicators or groups of indicators, 74.5\% (n = 542) were classified in process category and 89.5\% (n = 537) with chronic type of care (n = 428; 58.8\%) and effective domain (n = 423; 58.1\%) with the most frequent values in categorizations by dimensions. The results of this overview of reviews are valuable and imply the need for future research and practice regarding primary health care quality indicators in the most varied conditions and contexts to generate new discussions about their use, comparison and implementation.},

  abstract = {In 2004, the UK introduced what was at the time the world's most ambitious pay-for-performance scheme, the Quality and Outcomes Framework or ‘QOF’. Twenty five per cent of general practitioners’ (GPs’) pay was tied to a complex set of 136 quality indicators, the majority of which were extracted electronically from GPs’ medical records.1 Typical indicators related to blood pressure control in hypertension or blood sugar control in patients with diabetes. However, GPs were given the opportunity to exclude patients from these quality calculations, and this was called exception reporting. If a GP ‘exception reported’ a patient (or an individual indicator), that patient (or indicator) was removed from the quality calculation with no financial penalty to the GP. The rationale for exception reporting was that even the best evidence-based guidelines were never intended to apply to all patients who visit their doctor. For example, it would be inappropriate to expect a GP to try rigorously to control cholesterol in a patient with diabetes dying of lung cancer. Exception reporting was therefore designed to allow doctors’ discretion to use their clinical judgement in deciding what treatments were appropriate for individual patients. The system was also designed so that doctors were not penalised if patients were non-compliant with requests for routine follow-up appointments or if patients did not wish to receive a particular investigation or treatment. The full list of reasons that doctors could record when deciding to exception report a patient is shown in box 1.2 Box 1  \#\#\# Eligible reasons for exception reporting ▸\hspace{0.6em}Patients who have been recorded as refusing to attend review who have been invited on at least three occasions during the financial year to which the achievement payments relate. ▸\hspace{0.6em}Patients for whom it is not appropriate to review the chronic disease parameters due to particular circumstances, …},

In the United Kingdom, most patients are managed in primary care. Hence if larger practices provide better quality of care; this would have important implications for the future organization of primary care services. We examined the association between quality of primary care for cardiovascular disease achieved by general practices in England and Scotland by general practice caseload, practice size and area based deprivation measures, using data from the New General Practitioner (GP) Contract. Methods: We analyzed data from 8,970 general practices with a total registered population of 55,522,778 patients in England and Scotland. We measured practice performance against 26 cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease, left ventricular disease, and stroke) Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) indicators for patients on cardiovascular disease registers and linked this with data on practice characteristics and census data. Results: Despite wide variations in practice list sizes and deprivation, the prevalence of was remarkably consistent, ( coronary heart disease, left ventricular dysfunction, hypertension and cerebrovascular disease was 3.7\%; 0.45\%; 11.4\% and 1.5\% respectively). Achievement in quality of care for cardiovascular disease, as measured by QOF, was consistently high regardless of caseload or size with a few notable exceptions: practices with larger list sizes, higher cardiovascular disease caseloads and those in affluent areas had higher achievement of indicators requiring referral for further investigation. For example, small practices achieved lower scores 71.4\% than large practices 88.6\% (P {$<$} 0.0001) for referral for exercise testing and specialist assessment of patients with newly diagnosed angina. Conclusion: The volume-outcome relationship found in hospital settings is not seen between practices in the UK in management of cardiovascular disorders in primary care. Further work is warranted to explain apparently poorer quality achievement in some aspects of cardiovascular management relating to initial diagnosis and management among practices in deprived areas, smaller practices and those with a smaller caseload.},

A separate systematic literature review was conducted to identify papers with information on the impact of the framework on inequalities.ResultsAll studies were observational, and so it cannot be assumed that any changes were caused by the framework. The results both for individual indicators and from different studies vary substantially. The diverse nature of the research precluded formal synthesis of data from different studies. Achievement of quality standards was high when the contract was introduced, and has risen each year roughly in line with the pre-existing trend. Inequalities in achievement of standards were generally small when the framework was implemented, and most have reduced further since. There is weak evidence that achievement for conditions outside the framework was lower initially, and has neither worsened nor improved since. Some interventions in the framework may be cost-effective. Professionals feel consultations and continuity have suffered to some extent. There is very little research about patients' views, or about the aspects of general practice not measured, such as caring, context and complexity.ConclusionThe evidence base about the impact of the QOF is growing, but remains patchy and inconclusive. More high quality research is needed to inform decisions about how the framework should change to maximise improvements in health and equity.},

Despite its achievements, there are concerns that the QOF may offer poor value for money. Aim To assess the cost-effectiveness of QOF payments. Design of study Economic analysis. Setting England, UK. Method Cost-effectiveness evidence was identified for a subset of nine QOF indicators with a direct therapeutic impact. These data were then applied to an analytic framework to determine the conditions under which QOF payments would be cost-effective. This framework was constructed to assess the cost-effectiveness of QOF payments by modelling the incentive structure using cost-effectiveness thresholds of £20 000 and £30 000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, to represent good value to the NHS. It used 2004/2005 data on the QOF performance of all English primary care practices. Results Average indicator payments ranged from £0.63 to £40.61 per patient, and the percentage of eligible patients treated ranged from 63\% to 90\%. The proportional changes required for QOF payments to be cost-effective varied widely between the indicators. Although most indicators required only a fraction of a 1\% change to be cost-effective, for some indicators improvements in performance of around 20\% were needed. Conclusion For most indicators that can be assessed, QOF incentive payments are likely to be a cost-effective use of resources for a high proportion of primary care practices, even if the QOF achieves only modest improvements in care. However, only a small subset of the indicators has been considered, and no account has been taken of the costs of administering the QOF scheme.},

  abstract = {Background There has been much debate as to whether quality points allocated through the new general medical services contract are more difficult to achieve for practices in deprived and rural areas. We used multiple regression to assess the relationships between deprivation, rurality and the number of overall quality points achieved by each practice. Multiple deprivation was significantly inversely related to quality points achieved. Practices in villages and towns gained 2\% more quality points than urban areas and hamlets.},
