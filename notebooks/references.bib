  abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted healthcare activity. The NHS stopped non-urgent work in March 2020, later recommending services be restored to near-normal levels before winter where possible. Aims: Describe the volume and variation of coded clinical activity in general practice, taking respiratory disease and laboratory procedures as examples. Design and setting: Working on behalf of NHS England, we conducted a cohort study of 23.8 million patient records in general practice, in-situ using OpenSAFELY. Methods: We describe activity using CTV3 codes and keyword searches from January 2019-September 2020. Results: Activity recorded in general practice declined during the pandemic, but largely recovered by September. There was a large drop in coded activity for laboratory tests, with broad recovery to pre-pandemic levels by September. One exception was International Normalised Ratio test, with a smaller reduction(median tests per1000 patients in 2020:February 8.0;April 6.2;September 7.0). The pattern of recording for respiratory symptoms was less affected, following an expected seasonal pattern and classified as ``no change''. Respiratory infections exhibited a sustained drop not returning to pre-pandemic levels by September. Asthma reviews experienced a small drop but recovered, while COPD reviews remained below baseline. Conclusions: We delivered an open source software framework to describe trends and variation in clinical activity across an unprecedented scale of primary care data. The COVD-19 pandemic led to a substantial change in healthcare activity. Most laboratory tests showed substantial reduction, largely recovering to near-normal levels by September, with some important tests less affected whilst recording of respiratory disease codes was mixed.},

  abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly affected mortality worldwide1. There is unprecedented urgency to understand who is most at risk of severe outcomes, and this requires new approaches for the timely analysis of large datasets. Working on behalf of NHS England, we created OpenSAFELY\textemdash a secure health analytics platform that covers 40\% of all patients in England and holds patient data within the existing data centre of a major vendor of primary care electronic health records. Here we used OpenSAFELY to examine factors associated with COVID-19-related death. Primary care records of 17,278,392 adults were pseudonymously linked to 10,926 COVID-19-related deaths. COVID-19-related death was associated with: being male (hazard ratio (HR) 1.59 (95\% confidence interval 1.53\textendash 1.65)); greater age and deprivation (both with a strong gradient); diabetes; severe asthma; and various other medical conditions. Compared with people of white ethnicity, Black and South Asian people were at higher risk, even after adjustment for other factors (HR 1.48 (1.29\textendash 1.69) and 1.45 (1.32\textendash 1.58), respectively). We have quantified a range of clinical factors associated with COVID-19-related death in one of the largest cohort studies on this topic so far. More patient records are rapidly being added to OpenSAFELY, we will update and extend our results regularly.},

  abstract = {Objectives To investigate the optimal systolic blood pressure goal above which new antihypertensive medications should be added or doses of existing medications increased (``systolic intensification threshold'') and to determine the relation between delays in medication intensification and follow-up and the risk of cardiovascular events or death. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Primary care practices in the United Kingdom, 1986-2010. Participants 88 756 adults with hypertension from The Health Improvement Network nationwide primary care research database. Main outcome measures Rates of acute cardiovascular events or death from any cause for patients with different hypertension treatment strategies (defined by systolic intensification threshold, time to intensification, and time to follow-up over the course of a 10 year treatment strategy assessment period) after adjustment for age, sex, smoking status, socioeconomic deprivation, history of diabetes, cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease, Charlson comorbidity index, body mass index, medication possession ratio, and baseline blood pressure. Results During a median follow-up of 37.4 months after the treatment strategy assessment period, 9985 (11.3\%) participants had an acute cardiovascular event or died. No difference in risk of the outcome was seen between systolic intensification thresholds of 130-150 mm Hg, whereas systolic intensification thresholds greater than 150 mm Hg were associated with progressively greater risk (hazard ratio 1.21, 95\% confidence interval 1.13 to 1.30; P{$<$}0.001 for intensification threshold of 160 mm Hg). Outcome risk increased progressively from the lowest (0-1.4 months) to the highest fifth of time to medication intensification (hazard ratio 1.12, 1.05 to 1.20; P=0.009 for intensification between 1.4 and 4.7 months after detection of elevated blood pressure). The highest fifth of time to follow-up ({$>$}2.7 months) was also associated with increased outcome risk (hazard ratio 1.18, 1.11 to 1.25; P{$<$}0.001). Conclusions Systolic intensification thresholds higher than 150 mm Hg, delays of greater than 1.4 months before medication intensification after systolic blood pressure elevation, and delays of greater than 2.7 months before blood pressure follow-up after antihypertensive medication intensification were associated with increased risk of an acute cardiovascular event or death. These findings support the importance of timely medical management and follow-up in the treatment of patients with hypertension.},
